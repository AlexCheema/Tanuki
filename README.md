# Tanuki

## Overview

Tanuki is a trustless wallet scoring protocol. It uses ZKP‚Äôs to trustlessly read historical on-chain activity to calculate wallet scores. Wallet scores are modular enabling use cases like paymasters with loyalty-based subsidies and lending protocols with variable rates.

## Use Cases

1. Credit score protocols which offer different terms to users based on their scores.
2. NFT pricing models that consider the wallets' past interactions with the NFT to accurately estimate price.
3. Paymasters that determine the amount of gas fee reimbursement for each user. Currently, these methods are performed off-chain, resulting in centralized, less transparent, and trust-dependent systems.
4. Spam prevention on Lens: create a social credit score for accounts, only allow posting / interaction based on certain minimum score

### Taiko

#### ZK-Zone ü•∑
The core of the Taiko ZK-EVM are the ZK-EVM circuits! And the rollup makes use of ZKPs elsewhere as well. Sharpen your circuit writing skills and help improve Taiko while doing so.

### Polygon

#### ü§ù $5,000 Best Public Good with Account Abstraction or Gasless transactions on Polygon
Create a permissionless public good dapp with an app-like UX by sponsoring your users‚Äô gas fees using gasless transactions or by batching transactions into a single transaction. Learn more by reading up on ERC-4337: Account Abstraction and Gasless transactions.

Account Abstraction SDKs

Safe{Core} Account Abstraction SDKs support Polygon PoS Mainnet and Polygon PoS Mumbai Testnet.

Biconomy‚Äôs Gasless Transactions SDKs support Polygon PoS Mumbai Testnet with Mainnet and zkEVM networks coming soon.

In your project‚Äôs README, explain the UX optimization strategies you chose and link to relevant sections of code with your account abstraction implementation.
